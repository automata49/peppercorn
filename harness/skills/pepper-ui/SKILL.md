description: Use for Pepper responsive layout, typography, navigation, tables, Dashboard, stock dialog and visual-regression changes.

Read the UI/formatting sections in `docs/harness/CONTRACT.md`. For Folio brand/Home/theme/loading/PWA work also read `docs/design/FOLIO_IDENTITY_V2.md` and use the `folio-identity` skill.

Locate the existing shared component and CSS tokens before editing. Reuse shared primitives such as `StockRows`, `DecisionList`, disclosures, navigation icons and table tokens. Preserve data/calculation contracts while changing presentation.

Responsive / identity contract:
- **Folio Sunset Editorial + Pebble Liquid Glass** is the current visual system on desktop, mobile and iPad. Supplied B identity artwork remains pixel-authoritative; compact layouts may change density and navigation placement but not identity.
- Use the committed B wordmark/icon/launch/motif artwork instead of recreating them with text, CSS X geometry or generic gradients.
- Dashboard hierarchy is brand → Total/KR/US → **오늘의 시장** signal summary → category selector → **오늘의 주도주** → leadership classes → Insight. `오늘의 시장 > 전체 보기` opens **시장 신호**. The Market Signal page keeps sector and ETF core analysis expanded.
- Touch targets, no-horizontal-overflow and System/Light/Dark behavior are acceptance criteria. Progressive disclosure remains for secondary/dense editors, but must not hide the core sector heatmap or ETF analysis on 시장 신호.
- Pebble Liquid Glass is shared by major regions and primary classification controls: **대형주 / 중소형주 / 전체 / ETF**, with a visible `/` before ETF. Keep translucent warm glass, blur/saturation, inset highlight and irregular beach-stone radii; Keep nested numerical metrics and table rows unboxed.
- C is photography treatment only through the committed C photography asset; it is not chrome for cards/navigation and its flowing-wave motif is not a Folio UI motif.
- Robinhood can inform hierarchy and interaction economy, never Folio branding or colour.

Run `npm run build` and `npm run test:identity` for identity/responsive changes, then relevant/full `npm run test:ui`. Report measured layout and behavior, not a visual guess.

- MARKET-COLORS-1 / FLAT-METRICS-1 / PEBBLE-REGIONS-1 (user decision 2026-10-07): The secondary destination is **시장 신호**, retaining expanded sector → ETF content and Home's existing full-view link. KR signed changes use red gains / blue losses; US uses green gains / red losses. The nearest instrument/sector market owns colours, including mixed-market rows, daily/live returns, detail, grids and market-specific heatmap legends; zero/missing stays neutral. Colours are display-only and never alter ranking, classification or pass/fail status. Major regions (including 오늘의 주도주) and all four leadership controls share Pebble Liquid Glass: translucent paper-based fill, blur/saturation, inset highlight and beach-stone radii. Nested numerical metrics stay unboxed; non-gradient surfaces share the same theme paper base. This supersedes the prior selector-only glass restriction and flat major-region styling.

- LEADERSHIP-GLASS-2 (user decision 2026-10-07 18:58 KST): Home and Explore controls **핵심 주도 / 주도 후보 / 강세 전환 / 조정 중** use the same borderless Liquid Glass rounded rectangles (24px radius), never oval/percentage radii or coloured edge strips. Explore's group wrapper is unboxed with spacing between controls. Selected state uses a subtle coral-tinted glass fill and readable theme ink, never the legacy black fill; keyboard focus remains visible. Labels/counts retain safe padding, minimum touch sizes, and Light/Dark readability. This overrides beach-stone geometry for these four controls only; stock-category pebbles and major-region styling stay unchanged.

- STOCK-CARDS-2 / TRACKING-GLASS-1 (user decision 2026-10-07 20:17 KST): shared stock/ETF cards contain no initials avatar. KR displays company/fund name first with ticker secondary; US keeps ticker first and name secondary. Readable name/price/meta tokens scale with screen width; cards reflow by available container width, including phone/tablet landscape and portrait and desktop. Preserve actual trends, prices, returns, rankings and click targets. Tracking tabs 관심종목 / 보유종목 / 투자일지 use the same borderless rounded Liquid Glass and readable selected-state/focus treatment as leadership controls.

## LIFETIME-JOURNEY-1 — user decision 2026-10-10 (current)

This decision supersedes older Home/navigation placement rules only. Primary navigation is **오늘 / 발견 / 저널 / 여정**. Today follows the Motion App Store editorial demo: four large cover cards in a staggered 3:2 / 2:3 desktop grid, one-column phone layout, shared frame/image/title expansion into an accessible detail, and reverse transition to the original card. Covers contain the latest own page, a question/due review, discovery, and journey; supplied assets remain authoritative. The former analytical Home remains accessible as **시장 요약** (`dashboard`); its existing market/category/leader/ETF parity contracts still apply there. Discover retains the existing stock analysis and ranking. Journal links to the canonical Thesis, Research and Trading Journal editors. Journey adds a read-only personal timeline before interest/holdings/trade tabs. No screening, ranking, market colours or supplied brand assets change.

Six implementation stages: Folio-token shadcn-style Button/Slot/CVA primitives; Radix Tabs and Dialog focus/keyboard behavior; Motion shared-element journal card transitions respecting reduced motion; lazily loaded Lightweight Charts actual daily close zoom (existing PriceRsChart remains the default); lazy Tiptap structured journal editor with photo, vector ink, questions and dated revisions; Ticker-inspired web digit transitions retaining exact accessible values (no Android package). Existing GSAP owns launch only.

New lifetime entries are **device-local, account-scoped IndexedDB**, explicitly labelled, with JSON export/import; existing cloud workspaces are unchanged. No claim of cloud sync, OCR, native PencilKit or live AI. Pen/mouse ink is implemented; physical Apple Pencil/Safari fidelity requires device validation. Backup imports do not overwrite existing records. Per-entry atomic writes preserve other tabs and reject stale same-record edits. Notebook payload is limited before saving to preserve export/import round trips. Questions are editable answers from fixed prompts, not generated investment advice.

Keep body content legible on Paper. Glass is for interactive controls and transient surfaces; existing analytical glass contracts remain. Minimum 44px controls, canonical 390/834/1366/1440 checks, supplied wordmark, default Light, Dark/System, and existing chart gap/RS rules remain acceptance criteria. New notebook tests cover create/reload/revision, concurrent tabs, backups, photo/ink, keyboard tabs, reduced motion and real-close chart.
